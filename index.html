                Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Franklin Hu, and I'm originally from Madison, WI. I am currently a rising sophomore 
                at Vanderbilt University, pursuing majors in Computer Science and Applied Math, and a minor in Business. Currently, I am doing research in the 
                <a href="https://hrlblab.github.io/">HRLB Lab</a> under the guidance of Dr. Yuankai Huo. My academic journey has allowed me to explore the 
                intersection of technology, mathematics, and business, which has sparked my passion for problem-solving and innovation. I aspire to embark on a 
                career path that combines my diverse interests and skills, aiming to work in PM, SWE, or ML roles. Outside of my academics, I enjoy playing the 
                saxophone, competing in tennis and soccer, and capturing moments through photography.
